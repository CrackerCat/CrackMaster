Crack Master Releases R1 & R2  trigger with  Parallel port Acknowledge signal  (Port 379h)
You'll need a simple botton to short circuit on parallel port Acknowledge & Ground signal.
Something like the original I made 30 years ago :)
Note:
These releases are compatible with 386/486 mainboards and may won't execute properly on 
todays advanced hardwares. Specially R2 version will just load on motherboards that its
chipload.exe supports. You should run theses releases under real mode DOS. Windows  v86
emulators or DOS BOX utilities may won't work.   Don't  use  EMM386.EXE   driver  also.
It activates V86 mode and causes uncompatibility.
I didn't have original loader for OS386.BIN v3.32 so I put v3.35 in R2 package with a newer loader that also works for v3.35.
